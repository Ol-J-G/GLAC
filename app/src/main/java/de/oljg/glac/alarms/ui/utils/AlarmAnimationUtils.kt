/**
 * "Cloud-Like" brush to let clock chars look like passing "dark clouds" during light alarm.
 *
 * Black and white gradient colors were chosen, because it fits in any light alarm color sequence.
 * Means, the clock chars are always visible (if clock chars would be, let's say, medium gray,
 * they could not be recognized against the background, when a color during light alarm
 * would be very close to medium grey...which leads to bad UX imho (imagine you're tired, almost
 * at sleep, but take a look to the clock, and you cannot see the time, what would make most
 * people rather angry, I guess :>))
